MD5Helper

You'll probably want to download InstallShield LE so that you can build the installer as well.

The following link tells you what you need to know:

You can install it pretty easily by right-clicking the installer project in the Solution Explorer and clicking "Install"

After you've installed it, try right-clicking on a file and clicking "Calculate MD5 Hash".
If the file is very large, a progress window will appear to give you some idea of how long it's going to take.
